# social-network-api

## Description

This is an API for a social network web app where users can create an account, add their thoughts, (which can then be commented on) and then add friends. This programme uses `MongoDB` for database, `Mongoose` ODM, `Moment.js` for timestamps and `Express.js` for routing. `Insomnia` was also used to seed the data.

To see a video of the platform working in Insomnia, see here:
